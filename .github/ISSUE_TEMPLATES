title: 'Add REST APIs to Account Microservice: Implement CRUD Operations'

---

**As a** developer  
**I need** to add REST APIs to the account microservice  
**So that** other microservices can perform CRUD operations on customer accounts.

### Details and Assumptions
* The existing microservice has been set up with a Python Flask framework.
* Database operations for creating customer accounts are already implemented.
* The online lab environment is accessible for development and testing.

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given the account microservice with a Flask framework and existing database model,
When I implement the following REST API endpoints:
  - GET /api/customers
  - GET /api/customers/{id}
  - PUT /api/customers/{id}
  - DELETE /api/customers/{id}
Then other microservices can successfully read, update, delete, and list customer accounts.
